# Get ReWorld

 Hi, today Plasticky accompanied me to the sea.
 
 Usually, when I go to the sea I find objects on the ground, things that I have lost, like a banknote, or things that belong to the sea, like a fish jumped out of the water or a stone, or waste that very often is plastic and that some people throw overboard, without caring about the environment in which they themselves live. Choose where to put all the items, whether to give them to Plasticky, who puts them aside, whether to throw them in the trash, or whether to throw them overboard.
 
 This is the first minigame, engage and good luck! And after putting everything at its place, move on to the next page!
